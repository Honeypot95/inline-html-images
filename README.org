* Inline HTML images
Encode html images to base64, to save a http network request.

* Motivation
If you use =<style>=, and =<script>= tags to embed CSS and JavaScript into HTML in order to save a network
request, you may want to do the same with images.

This script helps do this automatically.

HTML supports base64 as a valid image encoding, which allows embedding images into the HTML source.
